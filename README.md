#Exercise

Complete the basics of the Trello layout. You don't have to match the colors exactly, but make the positioning and structure as close as you can.

#Iteration #1: Rows and columns

Both columns of the second of the larger rows need to be divided into rows and columns again. Identify the extra rows and columns and add them. Don't forget to plan with a diagram.

#Iteration #2: Fill out the header

Not that you have the general structure, start filling out the details of the content. Begin by adding the missing elements of the 3 columns in the header.

#Iteration #3: Menu

Now that you've got your header, let's turn our attention to the bottom part of the screen. The menu on the left seems to have a bunch of rows with text, icons and images. Add those missing elements.

#Iteration #4: Board

Finally, add the lists of the main Trello board. Each list looks like a column with rows of text and images. Add those elements.
